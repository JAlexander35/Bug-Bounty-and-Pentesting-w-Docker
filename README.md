# Bug-Bounty-and-Pentesting-w-Docker

Lab project where I implemented Docker containers where my goal was to:
1. Build virtual lab enviornment





I used VirtualBox along with a VM containing the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS and pulled my Docker containers through the terminal. 
There's a number of exploitable web applications that you can pull from Docker Hub that come loaded with vulnerabilites. For my experiement, I used "OWASP's Juice Shop" and "Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)".
